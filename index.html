                    Pakistani cuisine(Urdu: پاکستانی پکوان, romanized: pākistānī pakwān) can be characterized as a blend of regional cooking styles and flavours from across South, Central and West Asia.
                    Pakistani cuisine is influenced by Persian, Indian, and Arab cuisine.
                    The cuisine of Pakistan also maintains certain Mughal influences within its recipes and cooking techniques.
                    Pakistan's ethnic and cultural diversity, diverse climates, geographical environments, and availability of different produce lead to diverse regional cuisines.

                    Pakistani cuisine, as in the food culture of most Muslim nations, is structured around halal principles, which, for example,
                    forbid pork and alcohol consumption in accordance with Sharia law, the religious laws of Islam.
                    Many more details of halal regulations apply to meats, which types of animals are acceptable or “clean” for human consumption.

                    International cuisine and fast food are popular in major cities such as Islamabad and Karachi; blending local and foreign recipes (fusion food), such as Pakistani Chinese cuisine, is also common in large urban centres.
                    As a result of lifestyle changes, health trends, and new dietary research being published,
                    traditional ingredients such as masala (pre-mixed and ready-to-use) and ghee (clarified butter) with its health benefits and high smoke point have been increasingly popular.

                    Pakistan's national cuisine directly inherits both Indo-Aryan and Iranic culture coupled with Muslim culinary traditions.
                    Evidence of controlled preparatory cuisine in the region can be traced back to as early as the Bronze Age with the Indus Valley Civilization.
                    Around 3000 BCE, sesame, eggplant, and humped cattle were domesticated in the Indus Valley;[6] spices like turmeric, cardamom, black pepper and mustard were harvested in the region concurrently.
                    For a thousand years, wheat and rice served as basic comestibles in the Indus Valley.

                <h4>
                    The arrival of Islam in South Asia and intermittent conquests influenced the local cuisine of the region to a great degree.
                    Due to its Muslim-majority population, Pakistan's cuisine sees a strict observance of Islamic dietary laws. Most prominently,
                    forbiddance on the consumption of pork and alcohol by Islamic regulation has shifted the focus of Pakistani cuisine to other types of meat, such as beef, lamb, chicken, and fish, alongside a variety of fruits, vegetables, and dairy.

                    Pakistani dishes are known for being aromatic and spicy.
                    Some dishes contain liberal amounts of oil, contributing to a richer, fuller mouthfeel and flavour. Brown cardamom, green cardamom, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, mace, star anise and black pepper are the most commonly used spices in the making of a wide variety of dishes throughout Pakistan.
                    Cumin seeds, chili powder, turmeric, and bay leaves are also very popular. In the Punjab province, spice blends are characterized by their use of coriander powder. Garam masala (a mixture of aromatic spices) is a popular blend of spices used in several Pakistani dishes including Bannu Pulao.
